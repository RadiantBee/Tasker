# Tasker
A simple desktop application for managing ideas, tasks and memos.

Current version: 1.1.1

It was written entirely on Lua with Love 2d engine.
No other libraries were used.

I know that entry fields are kinda junky, but this is the best I can do for now.

You can change background color in colorConfig.txt
Every line reperesents a RGB value from 0 to 1
