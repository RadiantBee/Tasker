# Tasker
A simple desktop application for managing ideas, tasks and memos.

Current version: 1.2.0

It was written entirely on Lua with Love 2d engine.
Also Ulydev/push library was used to make window resizable.

### Features of 1.2.0:
- New save system! Now there are more save files and they can be managed easily!
So now it's possible to have different "task spaces"
- The entry fields now are a bit better! (They were worse, trust me...)
- UI Button descriptions! (the text is a bit sad looking tho because of resizability)

You can change background color in config
Every line reperesents a RGB value from 0 to 1
